# Cognizant CDE - Playboook

## CDE Expectations

Focus on programming foundation- CDE expects the associates to have solid Java/programming foundation skills: 
- Writing basic algorithms such as ‘checking for a palindrome’ as an example (practice lots of coding challenges) 
- Understanding program control flow 
- Problem solving using coding best practices. 
- Tracing and debugging errors in a program using tools such as SonarLint or the IDE debugger  
- Good understanding of test driven development in context to Java (JUnit), Angular/React (using Jasmine/Karma) 
- Focus on cloud services, agnostic to the cloud provider: 
- Understanding the various ‘popular’ services that cloud platforms provide. For eg. Compute services, storage services, load balancers, database services, scalability, reliability etc. 
- Understanding of generic cloud architecture irrespective of the cloud platform implemented.  

## Aron's Meeting

b.	Understanding program control flow
c.	Problem solving using coding best practices.
d.	Tracing and debugging errors in a program using tools such as SonarLint or the IDE debugger 
e.	Using code quality tools like SonarQube to write efficient code. 
f.	Good understanding of test driven development in context to Java (JUnit), Angular/React (using Jasmine/Karma)

2.	Focus on cloud services, agnostic to the cloud provider:
a.	Understanding the various ‘popular’ services that cloud platforms provide. For eg. Compute services, storage services, load balancers, database services, scalability, reliability etc.
b.	Understanding of generic cloud architecture irrespective of the cloud platform implemented. 

3.	Agile ceremonies and process:
a.	Understanding the various Agile ceremonies, even if it is conceptual. 
b.	Understand the daily stand-up mechanism, retrospective meetings, user story pointing and user story grooming activities. 

4.	MSA (questions would be asked for educational purposes only at this time since MSA coverage is just limited to an overview in the current curriculum)
a.	Understanding Microservices architecture in comparison with the traditional architecture. 
b.	High level overview of Debugging, load-balancing, orchestration, auto-scaling, containerization, discovery in context to microservices etc.
